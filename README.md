# RandomDocs
Just random docs and things that may save others from hours of pain. The level of sass is roughly equivalent to how much time I had to sink into this stuff to get it to work. 


So, here are all the links to my docs - they are not in any order and may be out of date/not there anymore depending on information that comes up and any conflicts with things/people.

1. Google Drive/ Google Signin API for Cordova setup
     Link: https://github.com/Rubicen/Google_API_Setup_Documentation
     Desc: Setup from creation of acc, the setup of the keys, the setup of API's, the keystore generation, the setup for the app, and 
     information that should be relevant as well as a test html file that will allow you to test if the setup is correct for the keys 

2. A not scammy key logger
     Link: https://github.com/Rubicen/KeyLogger_VISIBLE
     Desc: I understand that this is not something that many people want but it has saved me multiple times in finding odd issues with
     software handling touch poorly. It is upfront about what it is, please do not misuse this. I also accept no responsibility for
     anything going wrong with this or misuse of this. It is uploaded with good intentions.
